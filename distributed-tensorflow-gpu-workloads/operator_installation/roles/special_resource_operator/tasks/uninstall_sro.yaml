Please either increase the "task_timeout" value or try the following solution to force undeployment -- github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60807#issuecomment-408599873 -- although you may need to follow instructions here -- github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60807#issuecomment-410260006 -- You may also need to check if the SRO operator was partially undeployed. Partial undeployment can result in this error, too.'
